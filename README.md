# Bill-Splitter-App

his is a payment calculator I made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This layout is responsive to all screen sizes. This web app takes in user input for the bill amount, tip percentage, and amount of people splitting the bill. It then presents the user with the total tip per person and total amount per person. This has been a life saver for my friends and I.
